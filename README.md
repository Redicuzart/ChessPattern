# ChessPattern
Pattern discovery on chess board, chess database, 

In this project, we are trying to find out chess patterns as a matrix group. We define chess board as a 8 x 8 matrix. Each square has a dynamic value though a game and its variations. The Association Rules in this model: Black pieces are negative numbers, K=-1, Q=-2, R=-3, N=-4. B=-5, P=-6; White pieces are positive, K=1, Q=1, R=2///// Unoccupied Squares equal 0
